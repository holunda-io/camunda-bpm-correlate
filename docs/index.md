## Why should I use this?

Imagine you integrate your Camunda Engine into a larger application landscape.
In doing so the inter-system communication becomes important and questions on
communication styles and patterns arise. In the world of self-contained systems,
the asynchronous communication with messages is wide adopted. This library helps
you to solve integration problems around correlation of messages with processes.
